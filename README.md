## Retrospective

For basic frontend requirements spent around 6 hours spent among three days.

- Decided to use Chakra UI since it seems to be easier to set up styling to match UI requirements, also because it has built in utilities for dark theme.
- Spent so much time trying to set and extend a theme.
- Spent some time trying to be more precise on sizes as mobile was an optional but (at least for me) is required these days.
- Spent so much time trying to refactor and still needs some more refactoring.
- Overall, I really enjoyed making this challenge.
